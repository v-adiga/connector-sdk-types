## Description

This package exports type definitions for the Adobe Creative Cloud Connector SDK. It provides auto-completion and type checking capabilities which improves the TypeScript connector development experience.

## Usage Notes

This package contains Connector SDK type definitions. However, in itself this package is unusable.  You must install [@types/adobe\_\_ccweb-connector-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/adobe__ccweb-connector-sdk) instead, to use the Connector SDK type definitions in your Connector services.
